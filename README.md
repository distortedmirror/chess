# chess
Java chess program with GUI. This java program also works as an applet, in text mode, or on most any platform (MacOS, Linux, Windows, Solaris, etc) and also runs as a Java applet in browsers.  The original design was to build a generic two player game framework where most of the logic of the games can be shared via base classes in an object oriented mannner, as there are base classes for the search algorithm, the drag and drop GUI, the board representation and other classes that abstract a two player game.  Chess, Checkers and TicTacToe were all implemented (no double jumping for checkers and checkmate functionality isn't implemented as of yet).  The chess program implements the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning and has a drag and drop graphical user interface.
